# HideRank
I was interested in learning how to write chrome extensions, so for my first attempt I put together an extension to hide the rank column in the Moodle gradebook.
Anyone who was hoping for the rank information to be removed is free to use it.


To install:

1. Select "Download Zip" at the top right.

2. Unpack the archive to a directory of your choice.

3. Navigate to the extension manager in Chrome.

4. Either enter chrome://extensions in the URL bar or go to Hamburger Menu > More tools > Extensions

5. If it is not enabled already, enable developer mode (checkbox at the top right).

6. Select "Load unpacked extension..."

7. Select the directory into which the archive was unpacked.
